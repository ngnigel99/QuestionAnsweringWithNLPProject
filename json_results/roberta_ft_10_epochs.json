For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)).", "56e1b62ecd28a01900c67aa6": " x", "56e1b754cd28a01900c67abc": " complexity", "56e1b754cd28a01900c67abd": " computational", "56e1b754cd28a01900c67abe": " the Blum complexity axioms", "56e1b754cd28a01900c67abf": "", "56e1b754cd28a01900c67ac0": "", "56e1b8f3e3433e14004230e6": "The best, worst and average", "56e1b8f3e3433e14004230e7": " time complexity", "56e1b8f3e3433e14004230e8": " complexity", "56e1b8f3e3433e14004230e9": " n", "56e1ba41cd28a01900c67ae0": " deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort", "56e1ba41cd28a01900c67ae1": " worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order", "56e1ba41cd28a01900c67ae2": " O(n2)", "56e1bc3ae3433e1400423104": " the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem", "56e1bc3ae3433e1400423105": " algorithms", "56e1bc3ae3433e1400423106": " lower bounds", "56e1bc3ae3433e1400423107": " its worst-case complexity", "56e1bc3ae3433e1400423108": "", "56e1bd4acd28a01900c67afc": " big O notation", "56e1bd4acd28a01900c67afd": " constant factors and smaller terms", "56e1bd4acd28a01900c67afe": " big O notation", "56e1bd4acd28a01900c67aff": " independent of the specific details", "56e1c0f6cd28a01900c67b2c": " complexity classes", "56e1c0f6cd28a01900c67b2d": " framework", "56e1c0f6cd28a01900c67b2e": " variable", "56e1c2eee3433e1400423134": " the chosen machine model", "56e1c2eee3433e1400423135": " quadratic time", "56e1c2eee3433e1400423136": " single-tape Turing machines", "56e1c2eee3433e1400423137": " Cobham-Edmonds", "56e1c2eee3433e1400423138": " P", "56e1c3e1e3433e1400423148": " time or space", "56e1c3e1e3433e1400423149": " bounding the time or space", "56e1c3e1e3433e140042314a": " complexity classes", "56e1c4fce3433e140042314e": " BPP, ZPP and RP", "56e1c4fce3433e140042314f": " Boolean circuits", "56e1c4fce3433e1400423150": " probabilistic", "56e1c4fce3433e1400423151": " #P", "56e1c4fce3433e1400423152": " Interactive", "56e1c720e3433e140042316a": " time", "56e1c720e3433e140042316b": " time", "56e1c720e3433e140042316c": " hierarchy theorems", "56e1c720e3433e140042316d": "", "56e1c720e3433e140042316e": " quantitative", "56e1c7e2cd28a01900c67b74": " time and space hierarchy theorems", "56e1c7e2cd28a01900c67b75": " EXPTIME", "56e1c7e2cd28a01900c67b76": " PSPACE", "56e1c9bfe3433e1400423192": " reduction", "56e1c9bfe3433e1400423193": " another problem", "56e1c9bfe3433e1400423194": " X reduces to Y", "56e1c9bfe3433e1400423195": " reduction", "56e1c9bfe3433e1400423196": "", "56e1cbe2cd28a01900c67bac": " polynomial-time reduction", "56e1cbe2cd28a01900c67bad": " polynomial-time reduction", "56e1cbe2cd28a01900c67bae": "The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction.

The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy.", "5726b718dd62a815002e8dbf": " parallel importers like Mr Dassonville", "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0": " private actors", "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1": " Commission v France", "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2": " a protest", "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8": " 25", "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9": " France", "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea": " 2003", "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb": " cocoa butter", "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec": " Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages", "5726ba2c708984140094cf59": " Keck and Mithouard", "5726ba2c708984140094cf5a": " to prevent cut throat competition", "5726ba2c708984140094cf5b": " Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c": " Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e74": " to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement", "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e75": " the European Community", "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e76": "citizenship", "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e77": " Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie", "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e78": "", "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea6": " 1 to 7", "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea7": " Jean-Marc Bosman", "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea8": " Gaelic", "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea9": " Belgian Football Association v Bosman", "5726bc1add62a815002e8eaa": " Germany", "5726bcde708984140094cfbf": "Citizenship of the EU", "5726bcde708984140094cfc0": " social services that people can access wherever they move", "5726bcde708984140094cfc1": " Commission v Austria", "5726bcde708984140094cfc2": " higher education", "5726c002708984140094d073": " the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union", "5726c002708984140094d074": " they were non-discriminatory, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied", "5726c002708984140094d075": " Reyners v Belgium", "5726c002708984140094d076": " 49", "5726c002708984140094d077": " Commission v Italy", "5726c19add62a815002e8f8a": " 2006", "5726c19add62a815002e8f8b": " shipping toxic waste", "5726c19add62a815002e8f8c": " October 2007", "5726c19add62a815002e8f8d": " 2005", "5726c3da708984140094d0d9": " people who give services \"for remuneration", "5726c3da708984140094d0da": " Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether.

UK law only required \u00a31 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around \u20ac27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose", "5726c5a9f1498d1400e8eac8": " \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH", "5725b81b271a42140099d097": " Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle", "5725b81b271a42140099d098": " 5,500,000", "5725b81b271a42140099d099": " nine", "5725b81b271a42140099d09a": " four", "5725b81b271a42140099d09b": " over half of the planet's remaining rainforests", "5728349dff5b5019007d9efe": " Amazoneregenwoud", "5728349dff5b5019007d9eff": "The Amazon rainforest", "5728349dff5b5019007d9f00": " Brazil", "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01": " over half", "5728349dff5b5019007d9f02": " 16", "5729e2316aef0514001550c4": " moist broadleaf forest", "5729e2316aef0514001550c5": "", "5729e2316aef0514001550c6": " nine", "5729e2316aef0514001550c7": " Brazil", "5729e2316aef0514001550c8": " 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.

To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones, these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan) completed in 1863, none of this decoration survives, part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006. The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden, this includes the refreshment rooms, reinstated as the Museum Caf\u00e9 in 2006, with the silver gallery above, (at the time the ceramics gallery), the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public.

For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect

That same year, ABC launched a major expansion of its office facilities in New York City.

This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations.

It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term.
